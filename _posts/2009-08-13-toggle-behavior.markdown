## UPDATE: Fixed link to latest revision of ToggleBehavior
There is apparently already something out there that does this, but here is my "ToggleBehavior". Does not really do callbacks, but it works well otherwise. I'll try to fix the callbacks sometime soon.

It's a study on how to build a usable feature in CakePHP, this time being a behavior. Each revision is stored on the [CakePHP Bin](http://bin.cakephp.org), and you'll see a slow progression from something quick and dirty to a behavior that follows most CakePHP conventions. About the only convention not followed is the non-use of the Ternary Operator. I use it as I think it is neat, but you can make a new revision that doesn't.

Cheers if it works for you, and feedback is always welcome!
