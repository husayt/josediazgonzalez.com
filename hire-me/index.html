<p>I specialize in CakePHP-related work. Want to hire me?</p>

<p>
    <a href="http://github.com/josegonzalez/">My Github Profile</a>. I work on various CakePHP-related plugins and projects. I am an active contributor on several projects used throughout the community, such as the <a href="http://github.com/jrbasso/Upload">Upload project</a> and <a href="http://github.com/felixge/cakephp-authsome">Authsome plugin</a>. I also run <a href="http://cakepackages.com">Cake Packages</a>, an <a href="http://github.com/josegonzalez/cakepackages">open source</a> project that tracks CakePHP-related code.
