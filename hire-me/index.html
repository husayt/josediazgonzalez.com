<p><strong>Be warned, this is a bit of a rant.</strong></p>

<p>I'll admit, CakePHP work is interesting to me. I use it as a learning tool and constantly tinker with various extensions. For example, I have a project to <a href="http://github.com/josegonzalez/app_skellington">auto-generate an admin section based on the db config</a>, and one for <a href="http://github.com/josegonzalez/documentation">documentation in the form of tutorials</a>. I run a <a href="http://cakepackages.com">CakePHP plugin index</a> solely so student developers at <a href="http://www.pace.edu">my university</a> wouldn't have to look in 95 places for existing code.</p>


<h2>Obstacles</h2>
<p>That said, I have a job at a <a href="http://seatgeek.com">wonderful startup</a> that constantly challenges my ability to not fuck up - it's easier said than done! I'm currently finishing a BS in CS with a minor in Mathematics - and maybe Philosophy if I can get my act together - which means that finding a job where I would be a good fit is difficult. Here are the main obstacles:</p>

<h4>I am in downtown manhattan. Not Miami. Not Michigan. Not Chicago.</h4>
<p>What do these mean? Well, if you are in Miami or anywhere else in the world, I will only do remote work. I will NOT be on-site. This means that your job offer must be a remote if not in NYC.</p>

<h4>My schedule is difficult because of classes. Standups do not happen for me without holiday</h4>
<p>I have classes to attend. I will not be on call. I will attempt to work around this when possible, but if you require me to be on a conference call, or a standup, I will be mostly unable to comply. Class will come first.</p>

<h4>I like working at night</h4>
<p>I work at night all the time. Does your company need a night owl? If so, great, we'll probably get along awesomely. Can you handle payroll for night hours? If not, I probably won't be able to work with you. See the above paragraph for more info on why.</p>

<h4>I am likely younger than your entire team</h4>
<p>Please treat me as any other developer, not as a kid. If I mess up, let me know, and if I am doing great, good. This is important if only because I look a lot younger than I am.</p>

<h4>I do a lot of open-source CakePHP work. I will not stop doing so.</h4>
<p>I work on a lot of CakePHP open source projects. If taking a job at your company conflicts with this, it was nice talking to you. My current work is all non-CakePHP, so I don't think I have much of an issue. I will not compete with your application/client work. I may, at some future time, reuse the knowledge I've gained to create something useful. That is at my discretion, but do know that I will ensure that your IP remains your IP.

<h4>I work for a startup already</h4>
<p>Since I already work for a startup, I can't do anything in the ticketing industry for some number of years. It's in my contract. If you require more than freelance, I will require above and beyond what they provide in flexibility and mental stimulation.</p>

<p>I take slight offense when people make fun of my current job in some way. My coworkers and the cofounders are great and we've built an awesome application. I've learned a lot here, and have spent many nights toiling on complex features. Hopefully I can say the same about your company :)</p>

<h2> Still interested?</h2>
<p>That said, I do freelance work. Contact me for rates. They vary depending upon what you need done, how fast, your working environment, etc. The following is a general guideline for freelance work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use GIT or some other DCVS. SVN is okay, but I will be much more productive with a DCVS.
    <ul>
      <li>If you do not have a VCS, my fee has just doubled</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I do CakePHP work, not #INSERT FRAMEWORK HERE# or raw #INSERT LANGUAGE HERE#</li>
  <li>I will never do more work than is agreed upon</li>
  <li>A third of the estimate up front, another third halfway through, and the rest at the end</li>
  <li>I retain the right to fire you as a client</li>
  <li>Contract is king</li>
  <li>I do project and hourly work. We will decide jointly what works best</li>
</ul>

<p>I feel relieved. <a href="/about/">Contact me</a> if you are still even slightly interested.</p>
