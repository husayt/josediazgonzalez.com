h1. This is the data for my blog

It is automatically transformed by "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.

I was tired of having my blog posts end up in a database off on some remote server. That is backwards. I've lost valuable posts that way. I want to author my posts locally in Textile or Markdown. My blog should be easily stylable and customizable any way I please. It should take care of creating a feed for me. And most of all, my site should be stored on GitHub so that I never lose data again.

h1. Todo

* Fix the header navigation. It's currently showing the wrong current
* Convert to Textile. Pipe-dream, since everyone else has a hard-on for markdown.
* Don't regenerate the atom.xml file if no content has changed
* Sticky Footer, preferably in CSS
* -Keep the hire-me page up to date- Not looking for work
* Calendar view of posts? Maybe when I post daily
* Update all posts to keep them current
* Fix the selected work in @_includes/portfolio.markdown@
* Nicer method of including keywords in the layout
* -CSS/JS to fix codeblocks in posts-
* Hide the sidebar, or at least minimize it, when not in use
* JSON Search index?
